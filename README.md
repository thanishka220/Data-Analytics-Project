## ðŸš€ Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis with Segmentation  

### ðŸ“Œ Objective  
To analyze customer churn patterns, segment customers into loyalty groups, and provide actionable business recommendations to improve customer retention.  

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- **Telco Churn Dataset** (customer demographics, account details, and service usage).  

### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab Notebook  

### ðŸ“Š Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ cleaning and preparing the dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ churn distribution, tenure, monthly charges, contract type analysis.  
3. **Segmentation** â€“ categorized customers as:  
   - **Loyal**  
   - **At Risk**  
   - **Dormant**  
4. **Final Recommendations** â€“ strategies to reduce churn and increase retention.
5.  **Project Report (PDF available only for this project)**  

### âœ… Key Insights  
- Higher monthly charges and shorter tenure customers are more likely to churn.  
- Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate.  
- Segmentation allows personalized retention campaigns.

## ðŸŽ¬ Project 2: Movie Success Prediction and Sentiment Study  

### ðŸ“Œ Objective  
To predict movie success based on metadata features and sentiment analysis of critic reviews, and provide insights into the key drivers of success.  

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- Movie metadata (genre, budget, cast, director, release year, etc.)  
- Critic reviews for sentiment analysis.  

### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK/TextBlob for sentiment)  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Explainability: SHAP, ELI5  

### ðŸ“Š Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ handling missing values, encoding categorical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ distributions of ratings, budget vs. revenue, genre trends.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ extracting polarity scores from critic reviews.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Random Forest Classifier for movie success prediction.  
5. **Model Explainability** â€“ feature importance (SHAP, ELI5).  

### âœ… Key Insights  
- Budget, genre, and sentiment scores significantly impact movie success.  
- Sentiment analysis adds an additional predictive layer beyond metadata.  
- Feature importance highlights actionable drivers for success strategies.
